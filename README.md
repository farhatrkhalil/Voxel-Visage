# Voxel Visage - 3D Face Reconstruction App

Voxel Visage is a powerful 3D Face Reconstruction app that leverages a locally hosted API for face and landmarks recognition. The API generates the necessary .obj files, which are then displayed in the application. Internet connection is required for this functionality.

This repository contains the source code and resources for an efficient 3D face reconstruction algorithm, offering users a seamless experience through an Android application developed using both Java and Kotlin in Android Studio.

## Features

- View 3D models on Android devices.
- Support for STL (ASCII and binary) files.
- Limited support for OBJ (Wavefront) and PLY (Stanford) files.
- Download and share 3D models.
- Requires internet connection for face and landmarks recognition.
